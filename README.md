This notebook features part of a Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Program Fall-22 program project titled: QML for reduced order density matrix time propagation https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-fall-22/issues/34

In this notebook we consider a Hamiltonian-learning problem to reproduce a given time series.
